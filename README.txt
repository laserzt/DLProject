---GAN execution---

We had some trouble to run the original source code on our computers due to lack of GPU.
The code here is just an example of the original code and we cant be sure if it runs correctly.
For runnable code we crated Google Colab notebook.

You can access the notebook in this link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uHMRVVJsQU5eOxSwyPFQ8Z0_MbfrQ2VH?usp=sharing

To run the code click run and the colab will ask you to connect to google account.
please use this account.

The environment is ready to run. We uploaded some prepared data for the algorithm to learn, and we uploaded a file which you can sample from.
once the execution will over you will have newsong.mid in the working directory.
